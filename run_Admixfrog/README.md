# Calling Neandertal ancestry

This folder contains the pipeline that was used to call Neandertal ancestry from ancient and present day individuals using a method by Benjamin Peter called admixfrog. There are two snakemake pipelines: one takes bam files as input, which is recommended for admixfrog when using low coverage acnient genomes and the oterh takes single VCf file (one per individual with all sites present). The bam and VCf files for the study were downloded from the European Nucleotide Archive.
